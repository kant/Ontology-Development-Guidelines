# Desired Features of Ontologies

The following are desired feartures of ontologies. The ontologies in this project aim to exemplify these features.

High subject-matter coverage
High subject-matter capture 
Revisability
Consistency
Coherence
Open-world assumption

Using the most expressive formalism language available will help achieve a high degree of subject-matter capture, i.e. a high degree of knowledge capture, or representing knowledge in the target domain of interest.
