## Desired Features of Ontologies

The following are desired feartures of ontologies. 

* Subject-matter coverage
* Subject-matter capture 
* Revisability
* Consistency
* Coherence
* Open-world assumption
* Expressive knowledge representation language formalism - Using the most expressive formalism available should help achieve a high degree of subject-matter capture, i.e. a high degree of knowledge capture, or representing knowledge in the target domain of interest. However, there may be fewer tools to support it. Tradeoffs are often necessary between expressivity and computability. Beginning with formal analysis, e.g., pen to paper using first and higher order logics may provide a picture of how to capture subject-matter knolwedge in a highly expressive manner before selecting a formalism.
