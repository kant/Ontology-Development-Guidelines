## The Intended Meaning of your ontology constructs and terminology

This describes the importance of understanding and asserting the intended meaning of the classes, relations, and other ontology constructs as well as the terms (or lexical labels) assigned to each construct.

Ontology Construct / Symbol-structure = the class, relation, individual, etc.
Label / Term = the lexical string assigned to an ontology construct.

E.g., 
Class construct = Stellar_Body
Label = 'stellar body'

### Metadata

- Distinguish between the construct or symbol-structure being created in the ontolgy (e.g., an OWL Class, OWL Object Property) and any lexical label (a display label) assigned to the construct.
  - Assert a metadata annotation construct to document the purpose or description of the construct itself.
  - Assert a metadata annotation construct to document the definition of the associated natural language label.
