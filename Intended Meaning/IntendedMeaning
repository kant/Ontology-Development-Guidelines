Intended Meaning

The intended meaning of the constructs in an ontology (i.e., the classes, indivdiuals, relations, properties) is essential to capture.
It can be captured by including definitions for each construct in the ontology.

For a given thing (from the target subject matter or domain of the ontology

An ontology has a scope. The degree to which it formally captures/represents/models the scope is the degree of coverage.
The scope of an ontology includes various specific things.
Each identified and desired thing to be captured should be formally represented with an ontology construct (class, relation, individual, property, etc.).
Each construct should be given a defintion or desription that expresses the intended meaning of that construct, and that expresses an understanding of the thing.
Each construct should be given a natural-langauge label, i.e., a term (e.g., a name) that matches the definition and thus the intended meaning as closely as possible. 

The construct is a computable symbol for the thing in the target domain.
The definition expresses the meaninig of that symbol to humans and machines.
The name (label, or term) is a string symbol linked to the construct. 
In this way, we can consider the constructr or elements of an ontology to be a composite.

Semantic web languages provide metadata annotation elements for definitions and labels, e.g., rdfs:label, dc:description, owl:comment
These can be used. To more narrowly focus on, say, a definition, you may create a annotatation such as 'definition'.
