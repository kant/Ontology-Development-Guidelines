Guidelines for developing Identifiers


Depending on the purpose and application, you may assign semantically-neutral identifiers for all constructs in the ontology, i.e., for all classes, instances/indivdiuals, relations, properties, etc.
Select a format for identifiers, e.g., random-generated alphanumeric, sequential numeric, etc.

Depending on the purpose and applicaiton, natural-language identifiers alone may be desired.
