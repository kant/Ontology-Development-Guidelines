# Ontology Development Guidelines
This repository contains descriptions and documents that succinctly desribe how to develop an ontology and methodological aspects for doing so. Guidelines and practices are offerred, which are also used for the projects contained in this GitHub account. Below is a summary of a generic ontology development methodology.

## Development Stages
A generic ontology development methodology includes the following: identifying and scoping your topic area; corpus or domain material research; creating a defined set of terms, a taxonomy and classificaiton system; and both applications of and data for that system. It is iterative and non-linear: some phases of the development process may be enacted concurrently, and revisited.

### PURPOSE
- Identify purpose(s) or function(s) for the ontology. What is it for?

### USE-CASES
- Identify use-cases for the ontology. Where may it be applied? What systems may benefit from it? What are situations in which it could be used?

### REQUIREMENTS & SPECIFICATION DETIALS
- Identify what will be required to realize the PURPOSE and satisfy the USE-CASES. 
- Identify specification details: 
	- the natural language, 
	- the computable (knowlede representation or implementation langauges), 
	- stylistic conventions, e.g., naming conventions for terms/labels, etc.  
	- Identify or create competency questions: queries that the ontology (and datasets) can be asked computationally.
- Select, Acquire or Develop resources and tools, e.g., ontology editor software, knowledge representation language, 
- Serialization format, corpora, data sources, contibutors, partners, subject-matter experts, etc.

### SCOPE
- Identify the boundaries of the university of discourse  that the ontology(s) will represent.

### RESEARCH & ANALYSIS
- Research corpora from the universe of discourse.

### LIST
- Identify & list specific things in the universe of discourse you want the ontology to represent.
- Identify & list concepts and terms needed to describe the things in universe of discourse. 
- Where a concept (idea or intended meaning) does not have a term to express it, then create one.

### DEFINITIONS
- Identify the intended meaning for each of the list of things, concepts and terms.
- May be from dictionaries, publicaitons, subject-matter experts, or custom-made. 
- Identify undefined or primitive terms. 
- Write definitions in natural-language that most closely expresses that intended meaning.
- For all primitive terms, state they are undefined, but also provide a clarifying note to provide the user with some sense of meaning. 

### STRUCTURE
- In this process, identify how the things or terms denoting them are related (if at all).
 - Create or select terms for how they are related (i.e., for the relationships between them).
 - Define these relational terms.
 - Use abstract distinctions and structuring relations, e.g., category vs. instance, class vs. member, class and subclass, broader & narrower, etc. 

### FORMALIZE
- Develop semi-formal or formal logical definitions. Translate the natural language definitions into first-order logic for precision. Translate the n-l def into the chosen ontology language, or ontology editor tool’s language, e.g., OWL, etc.
- Formal definitions may use the labels to better foster automation.
