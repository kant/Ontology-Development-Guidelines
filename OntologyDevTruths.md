# Truths about Ontology Development
An eye on ethics

## Be innovative and creative.
1. You can create your own ontology
- You can create your own subject-specific ontology (sometimes called: domain ontology, application ontology, lower-level ontology, etc.)
- You can create your own generic ontology (sometimes called: general ontology, foundational ontology, base ontology, upper-level ontology, top-level ontology, core ontology, etc.)

2. You do not have to reuse existing ontology.
- Anyone that tells you you must (or is agressive about it), is very likely trying to get you to use theirs.

## Be informed, be aware, and be responsible.
3. If you're considering using an existing ontology, you _should be informed_ about what you are committing to
- Be aware of all commitments an ontology makes
- Be aware of the assumptions, philosophical worldviews, and ontological commitments of an ontology you are considering reusing. (read documentation, look at the ontology at all levels of abstraction)
- Be aware of any imported ontologies or taxonomies the candidate ontology commits to or uses.
(Be aware of other ontologies or semantic resources you may be committing to by using the candidate ontology.)

4. You have a right to understand what an ontology is saying about the world.
- Do not believe the "black box" saying that an ontology should be hidden from users or end-users. Anyone that tries to convince you of this is probably trying to push their ontology on you.
- Being informed and having information is always better than not.

5. Ontologies may not be the solution.
- There are other technologies and methods to achieve the same purported results

6. You do not need an generic/upper/top-level/foundational ontology
- There are other tech and methods to achieve the same results

## Common Sense and Ethics - some fallacious or invalid arguments

6. Popularity does not mean quality
- # of users (user-base) does not mean an ontology is good, or useful.
