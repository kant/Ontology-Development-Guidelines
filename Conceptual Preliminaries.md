## Preliminaries of Ontology Development: Some conceptual and ontological distinctions 

Some basic distinctions made in modeling (conceptual, ontological, semantic, linguistic, etc.), which are partially drawn from abstract and philosophical inquiry, are:

### The generic - The specific

The concept of the generic, the general, the universal, etc. is distinguished from that of the specific, the indvidiual, the particular, etc. 
Historically this is partially a reflection of human philosophical inquiry into attribute-agreement, or how things can be similar, how the seem to have the same attributes, characteristics, etc. 

This is basic distinction is exemplified by some more specific ones such as:

* category - instance
* class - member
* set - element


### Characteristics - Possessors of characterstics

This is the distinction between a property (or characteristic) and property-bearer.
