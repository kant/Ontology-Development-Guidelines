Definitional Guidelines

1) Include at least one natural-language definition or description for each construct, i.e., for each class, individual, relation, property, etc.
2) Include a computable definition that matches the natural-language definition as closely as possible. 
NOTE: as much as possible during the translation from natural-language definition to formal definition, limit the loss of expressivity. It can be limited by using a formal langauge that has high expressivity and minimal language bias, and more generally by spending time on conceptual analysis, hand-made first- and second-order logic translation of the n-l def., etc.) 
3) Have annotation notes or metadata tags for each, e.g., labeled as 'Natural-language Definition'
Note: consider degrees and types of definition, e.g., natural-language, semi-formal, formal, first-order logic definition, etc.
